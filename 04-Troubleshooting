Troubleshooting         The process of identifying, analyzing and solving problems.
Debugging               The process of identifying, analyzing and removing bugs in a system.

Reproduction Case       A clear description of how and when the problem appears; a way to verify if the problem is present or not
Root Cause              Understanding the root cause is essential for performing the long-term remediation
    Hypothesis          Whenever possible, we should check our hyothesis in a test environment, instead of our production envirenment 
                                that our users are working with. 
System Calls            Calls that the programs running on our computer make to the running kernel
Observer Effect         Oberving a phenomenon alters the phenomenon
Power cycling           releases resources stored in cache or memory, which gets rid of the problem

Bisecting               cut problem in half and test each half seperately
                        cut possiblities for crash in half and test first half
                                 if first half causes the failure, the fault is in this group; else it's in the second
                                 continue further
                        there is also a command "git bisect"!?

Problem Solving Steps
1. Getting Information
2. Finding the root cause
3. Performing the necessary remediation

    kill -stop                # stops a program which can be continued or terminated
strace                        # logs system calls, e.g. "strace ./run_program.py"

iotop                         # shows which processes use the most input and output
nice                          # reduce priority of a process
top                           # shows state of computer and processes using the most cpu
                              # Load Average: shows how long a processer is busy in a given minute with 1 meaning it was busy all the time
                              #               normally this number should not be greater than the number of processors
                              #               if it is higher than the computer is overloaded
vmstat                        # shows statistics on the virtual memory operations


tcpdump                       # powerful command-line analyzer that captures or "sniffs" TCP/IP packets
wireshark                     # open source tool for profiling network traffic and analyzing TCP/IP packets

Getting Information

- What were you trying to do? 
- What steps did you follow? 
- What was the expected result? 
- What was the actual result?

- Consider simplest explanation first!

System Logs:
  - on Linux:       /var/log/syslog
                    .xsession-errors
  - on Mac OS       /Library/Logs
  - on Windows      Event Viewer

Linear Search        search from top to bottom
Binary Search        list must be sorted (sorting takes no time), but honestly does not make any sense if just one element is searched
                     compare to the middle element
                     > search in the second half, especially compare the middle element of the second half
                     < search in the first half, especially compare the middle element of the first half
